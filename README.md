# KivyHiWorld

This is my first ever Kivy app. It displays a button which when clicked on, displays a popup with text and button.

**This app only works on Python 3.9 as far as I can tell so please use that**

## Dependencies

Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and are installable using `pip`.
